<p>Welcome to my demo reel. After completing a diploma in advanced visual effects,
  where I learned the basics using tools like Maya, Nuke, Houdini, Katana, Substance Painter, and ZBrush,
  I specialized in compositing during my final four semesters.This journey led to a role as a Compositing Technical Director,
  where I've contributed for six months from October 2023 to April 2024.</p>
  <p>This reel showcases a blend of projects, highlighting my evolving skills in compositing to create visually compelling narratives,
    demonstrating both my foundational knowledge and the specialized expertise I've developed in this field..</p>
