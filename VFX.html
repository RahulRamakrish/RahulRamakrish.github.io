<p>Welcome to my demo reel. As a Junior Compositing Technical Director with six months of immersive experience in the dynamic world of visual effects, I've embarked on a journey filled with learning, creativity, and a deepening passion for bringing imagination to life.</p>
  <p>In this short span, I've had the opportunity to delve into the intricacies of compositing, working with tools like Nuke, Maya, and Houdini to create seamless visual narratives.</p>

<p>This reel represents not just the culmination of my work so far but a testament to my dedication and eagerness to grow within this field.
  Each clip is a learning milestone, showcasing my evolving understanding of color, light, and texture, and how these elements coalesce to form the visual storytelling that captivates us.</p>

<p>Though my professional journey is just beginning, my commitment to this art form runs deep. I invite you to view my reel, a reflection of my foundational skills and my potential for growth.
  I look forward to the opportunities and challenges ahead, eager to contribute my creativity and technical skills to the world of visual effects.</p>
