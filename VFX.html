<p>Welcome to my demo reel. As a Junior Compositing Technical Director, I've dedicated six months to immersing myself in the vibrant realm of visual effects.
  This journey has been a blend of rapid learning and creative exploration, leveraging industry-standard tools like Nuke, Maya, and Houdini to craft compelling visual narratives.
  This collection of work is more than a showcase; it's a story of my evolving grasp on the nuanced play of color, light, and texture, and how they merge to tell captivating visual stories.</p>

<p>In the early stages of my career, my commitment to the art and science of compositing is deep and driven. Each piece in this reel marks a significant step in my journey,
  reflecting a steadfast dedication to growth and a keen anticipation for the future. As you view this reel, consider it both a display of my present abilities and a glimpse into the potential I aim to realize within the dynamic field of visual effects.</p>
