<p>Welcome to the intersection of creativity and technology, where my journey as a Junior Compositing TD merges stunning visual effects with intricate coding.
  With experience in VFX tools like Nuke, Maya, and Houdini, and a diverse coding background in C, Java, SQL, Python, and R, my portfolio is a testament to a relentless curiosity and a passion for blending art with technology.</p>
<p>Armed with a foundation in data science and analysis, I navigate the realms of both pixels and programming, presenting a unique fusion of skills that defy traditional labels.
  Whether you're here for professional curiosity or creative inspiration, I invite you to explore the possibilities that lie at the crossroads of our digital world.</p>
