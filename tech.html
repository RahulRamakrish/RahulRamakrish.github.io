<div class="intro">
  <h>Welcome to my technology showcase!</h>
  <p>My interest in technology started back in school when I first learned Java.
    Understanding the basics of programming made learning new languages straightforward, as the core principles are similar, only the syntax changes.
    This foundation led me to a 6-month data science course focused on machine learning foundations, followed by certifications in data analysis using Python and a Google Data Analytics certificate.
    These experiences deepened my understanding of how to work with, analyze, and visually represent data.</p>
  <p>In the realm of data science, I've gained valuable knowledge in predictive modeling, including techniques like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees.
    My Python skills are centered around predictive modeling, utilizing essential modules such as Numpy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for data visualization.
    Additionally, my certification journey introduced me to Tableau and GGplot in R, enhancing my ability to organize data, create advanced visualizations, implement mapping, and effectively present data findings.</p>
  <p>While pursuing a course in VFX, I also learned to code tools and gizmos for Nuke.
    Working as a junior compositing TD further expanded my tech skills, including front-end development and creating GUIs using Python's tkinter.
    My continuous learning also led me to code this website using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, hence letting me dip into web design as well.
    I'm continually broadening my coding knowledge in different operating systems like Linux, driven by my passion for learning and the diverse opportunities in the tech field.</p>
  <p>Below are my skills and certifications, reflecting my continuous learning journey in technology and data science.</p>
